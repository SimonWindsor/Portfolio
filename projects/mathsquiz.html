            <h2>About Project</h2>
            <p>
              This was my first independent project. My daughter was 5 years old at the time and learning basic mathematics and using formal abstract notation. I wanted to make a simple game that focusses only on basic addition and subtration, with a simple interface that can be used on a desktop computer or touch device. The game is aimed specifically for children aged 5-7 and aims to promote understanding and skills regarding basic mathematical operations using formal astract notation- where symbolic numbers and operator symbols are used.
            </p>
            <p>
              This page opens with a main menu, where the user can select the following game modes, which are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Addiition</li>
              <li>Subtraction</li>
              <li>Friends of Ten</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In addition to this there are also three difficulty levels. Friends of Ten mode only has one difficulty level and difficulty selection is disabled if it is selected.
            </p>
            <p>
              A game involves ten randomly-generated questions for the user to answer. There is a touchable and clickable number pad, with an "enter" button and "delete" button for user-input. But the user can also use a keyboard for input. A progress bar tracks progress through the game and sounds are used to indicate correct or incorrect answers. The game keeps track of questions that are asked so that the same question is not answered more than twice.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the user has answered all questions, an animation-sequence takes place that shows teh game results. A smiley face is displayed for each correct answer and a funny face for each in correct answer as well as their score out of ten.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project was started early in my learning journey with web development- and at the time I had not yet learned React or any other libraries or frameworks. The technologies used are HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              Challenges in making this project were responsiveness- particularly with the layout of the game, and making it work for different screen sizes. I also attempted an animation that made a smiley or funny face zoom in when a question was answered but I  didn't managed to implement it as succesfully as I wanted.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I were to carry out a similar project in future, I would target a more broader audience, and offer a wider selection of game modes. As well as formal notation (where symbolic numbers and operators are used), I'd like to include concrete representation of numbers (three apples in one bowl, two in another, and putting them all together to make five) and promote the connection between symbol and contrete. More operations and flexibility with difficulty could be implemented for older children- such as the ability to manually adjust the maximum size of the numbers used.
