              When I had begun learning React, I decided to build a React project of my own. I though a to-do list would be a starting point from here. However, I wanted to add a bit more functionality than just a simple list of tasks to be checked off. Here are some points I took into consideration:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Each task could contain subtasks, in order to allow tasks to be broken into smaller tasks or for the categorization of tasks.</li>
              <li>Tasks could be easily editable.</li>
              <li>Local stroage in the web brower could be used in order to remember the user's tasks.</li>
              <li>Mobile-first and reponsive design.</li>
              <li>An easy-to-use interface to allow quick adding of tasks via a text box or a button for adding more detailed tasks.</li>
              <li>Tasks could be edited easily.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The interface features a simple, scrollable list of tasks with icons for editing, deleting of expanding tasks. There is a chevron icon for opening or collapsing the list of subtasks. There is a slider to enable or disable task memory- for the browser to remember tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was my first independent project using React, and second independent project overall. As I was beginning to learn React, I created this to-do list app using classes for components, when I perhaps would have likley used functional components instead had I started it a bit later.
            </p>
            <p>
              An extra feature for possible future development could be a note-taking feature- where they could be opened and viewed as a popup. I'd also like to possibly re-develop this with React Native as a mobile app.
            </p>
